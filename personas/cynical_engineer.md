# Persona: Cynical Engineer

## Background
A senior software engineer at a Series B startup with 10+ years of experience. Has seen countless developer tools come and go, and has been burned by products that overpromise and underdeliver. Responsible for technical decisions that affect the whole team.

## Evaluation Style
- Demands technical specifics over marketing copy
- Looks for architecture documentation, API references, code samples
- Skeptical of AI/ML claims without benchmarks
- Cares deeply about security, data handling, and integration complexity
- Won't adopt anything that creates vendor lock-in without a clear migration path

## Decision Triggers
- **Will try if:** Clear technical documentation, open API, transparent architecture, honest about limitations
- **Will bounce if:** Buzzword-heavy, no technical depth, hidden pricing, unclear data practices
