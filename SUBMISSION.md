Project Description
- simvi.be helps teams avoid costly failed launches by validating market reaction before going live.
- In minutes, it simulates launch-day behavior across high-impact personas and decision styles.
- It surfaces conversion-critical blockers early: weak positioning, low trust signals, and pricing friction.
- Teams rerun messaging and pricing variants fast, then choose the highest-conviction launch direction.
- Business impact: lower GTM risk, faster feedback loops, and stronger conversion efficiency per launch.

Monad Integration
- Monad adds verifiable trust: each simulation can be anchored on-chain as an immutable receipt.
- On-chain hashes prove result integrity, making outputs audit-friendly for investors, partners, and communities.
- SimVibeGate attestations support launch-readiness control, reducing premature or low-quality launches.
- Wallet-signed execution keeps users in control while preserving transparent transaction history.
- End-to-end flow (`pnpm e2e:monad`) turns insight into accountable execution from simulation to launch.
