  Optional

## Platform Mode
- `Platform Mode`: `nad.fun` (default)
- `Token Name`:

- `Token Symbol`:

- `Launch Thesis`:
  `Meme culture drives early adoption in every L1 ecosystem. MonadMemes captures that energy by tokenizing meme curation — turning attention into governance power.`
- `Token Narrative`:
  `Every chain needs its culture layer. MonadMemes is the cultural heartbeat of Monad — where the best memes get rewarded and the community decides what is funny.`

- `Risk Assumptions`:
  `Meme tokens have high churn risk. No intrinsic utility beyond governance. Dependent on sustained community engagement. Vulnerable to copycat forks.`
