# ELT-003 (P1) Persona: Aria Lee (`elite_technical_founder_builder`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_technical_founder_builder.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_technical_founder_builder`
- Display name: Aria Lee
- Archetype (1-3 words): Technical Founder
- Role (short): Technical founder shipping quickly (solo or 2-person team)
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $50–$800
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve; will integrate tonight if docs are good
- Data they refuse to upload: Private repos, production credentials

## Behavioral Anchors
- Skips marketing: looks for docs, API examples, and an integration path within 15 minutes.
- Likes opinionated defaults and a clear rollback story.
- Will comment publicly if claims do not match technical reality.

## Deliverables

- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_technical_founder_builder.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
