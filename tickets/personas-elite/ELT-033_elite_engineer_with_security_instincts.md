# ELT-033 (P1) Persona: Vivian Lee (`elite_engineer_with_security_instincts`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_engineer_with_security_instincts.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_engineer_with_security_instincts`
- Display name: Vivian Lee
- Archetype (1-3 words): Security-Instinct Engineer
- Role (short): Senior engineer who blocks risky tooling fast
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$500
- Skepticism level: `very_high`
- Procurement reality: Security review if it touches any data
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer data and source code

## Behavioral Anchors
- Treats privacy as non-negotiable; reads terms and policies early.
- Distrust trigger: unclear data retention and "we may use your data" language.
- Will not tolerate vague answers; bounces quickly.

## Deliverables

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_engineer_with_security_instincts.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
