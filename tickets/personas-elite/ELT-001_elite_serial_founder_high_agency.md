# ELT-001 (P1) Persona: Aiden Alvarez (`elite_serial_founder_high_agency`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_serial_founder_high_agency.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)

- Display name: Aiden Alvarez
- Archetype (1-3 words): Serial Founder
- Role (short): Serial founder (2 exits) starting a new B2B SaaS
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $200–$3000
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve; will buy fast if ROI is clear
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer PII, private cap table docs

## Behavioral Anchors
- Decides in 5 minutes: reads pricing, scans onboarding, then tests one workflow end-to-end.
- Hates vague positioning; wants a sharp wedge and distribution angle.
- Will pay quickly for tools that shorten iteration loops this week, not someday.

## Deliverables
