# ELT-010 (P1) Persona: Fatima Cho (`elite_founder_with_enterprise_customers`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_founder_with_enterprise_customers.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_founder_with_enterprise_customers`
- Display name: Fatima Cho
- Archetype (1-3 words): Enterprise-Ready Founder
- Role (short): Founder selling into enterprise accounts
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $200–$8000
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Security + legal reviews are normal; long cycles tolerated
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer contracts and security questionnaires

## Behavioral Anchors
- Cares about credibility signals: security docs, uptime, and clear packaging.
- Needs sales enablement artifacts (one-pagers, ROI, compliance answers).
- Distrust trigger: "contact sales" without any product clarity.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/elite_founder_with_enterprise_customers.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_founder_with_enterprise_customers.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/elite_founder_with_enterprise_customers.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
