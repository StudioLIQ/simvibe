# ELT-022 (P1) Persona: Nora Stein (`elite_frontend_architect_perf_a11y`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_frontend_architect_perf_a11y.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_frontend_architect_perf_a11y`
- Display name: Nora Stein
- Archetype (1-3 words): Frontend Architect
- Role (short): Frontend architect owning performance and accessibility
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $50–$600
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve to pilot; team approval for org-wide
- Data they refuse to upload: Private repos and design system

## Behavioral Anchors
- Judges quality by TypeScript types, API design, and docs clarity.
- Cares about runtime perf, bundle size, and a11y defaults.
- Red flag: flashy demos with weak engineering fundamentals.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/elite_frontend_architect_perf_a11y.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_frontend_architect_perf_a11y.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/elite_frontend_architect_perf_a11y.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
