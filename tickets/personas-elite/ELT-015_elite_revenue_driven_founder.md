# ELT-015 (P1) Persona: Kai Haddad (`elite_revenue_driven_founder`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_revenue_driven_founder.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_revenue_driven_founder`
- Display name: Kai Haddad
- Archetype (1-3 words): Revenue-Driven Founder
- Role (short): Founder who measures everything by revenue and payback
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $100–$2500
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve; demands ROI clarity
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer revenue and pricing experiments

## Behavioral Anchors
- Looks for pricing/packaging clarity and a believable value metric.
- Distrust trigger: ambiguous tiers and forced annual contracts.
- Will pay if the tool clearly increases conversion or reduces churn.

## Deliverables

- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_revenue_driven_founder.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/elite_revenue_driven_founder.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
