# ELT-040 (P1) Persona: Ben Cho (`elite_ai_product_researcher`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_ai_product_researcher.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_ai_product_researcher`
- Display name: Ben Cho
- Archetype (1-3 words): AI Product Researcher
- Role (short): Researcher mapping AI capabilities to real product value
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $50–$800
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; wants credible claims
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer research and competitive intel

## Behavioral Anchors
- Asks: what user job does this solve, and what is the failure cost?
- Trusts tools that separate "demo" from "production" clearly.
- Red flag: hype language and lack of constraints.

- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
