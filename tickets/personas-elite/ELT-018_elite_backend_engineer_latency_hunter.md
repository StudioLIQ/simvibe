# ELT-018 (P1) Persona: Linh Tanaka (`elite_backend_engineer_latency_hunter`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_backend_engineer_latency_hunter.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_backend_engineer_latency_hunter`
- Display name: Linh Tanaka
- Archetype (1-3 words): Latency Hunter
- Role (short): Senior Backend Engineer obsessed with performance
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$300
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve; team approval for production
- Data they refuse to upload: Production traces with identifiers

## Behavioral Anchors
- Looks for real numbers: p95, p99, throughput, and regressions.
- Trusts tools that show impact with minimal instrumentation.
- Red flag: performance claims without measurement method.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/elite_backend_engineer_latency_hunter.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_backend_engineer_latency_hunter.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/elite_backend_engineer_latency_hunter.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
