# ELT-083 (P1) Persona: Grace Cohen (`elite_procurement_lead_fast_track`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_procurement_lead_fast_track.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_procurement_lead_fast_track`
- Display name: Grace Cohen
- Archetype (1-3 words): Fast-Track Procurement
- Role (short): Procurement lead who can move quickly when docs are ready
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $1000–$20000
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Vendor onboarding + legal; expects standard docs
- Data they refuse to upload: Contracts and vendor evaluations

## Behavioral Anchors
- Wants standard legal docs available up front: DPA, security page, terms.
- Distrust trigger: unclear pricing and surprise add-ons.
- Cares about exit terms and vendor stability.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/elite_procurement_lead_fast_track.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_procurement_lead_fast_track.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/elite_procurement_lead_fast_track.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
