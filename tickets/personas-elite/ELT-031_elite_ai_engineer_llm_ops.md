# ELT-031 (P1) Persona: Tessa Alvarez (`elite_ai_engineer_llm_ops`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_ai_engineer_llm_ops.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_ai_engineer_llm_ops`
- Display name: Tessa Alvarez
- Archetype (1-3 words): LLM Ops Engineer
- Role (short): AI engineer shipping LLM features into production
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $100–$2000
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; privacy and compliance constraints
- Data they refuse to upload: Prompt logs with customer data, model eval sets

## Behavioral Anchors
- Cares about evals, monitoring, cost controls, and data retention.
- Trusts tools that show failure cases and guardrail strategies.
- Red flag: "magic" LLM claims without numbers and controls.

## Deliverables

- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_ai_engineer_llm_ops.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
