# ELT-014 (P1) Persona: Jae Bianchi (`elite_hyperproductive_builder`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_hyperproductive_builder.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_hyperproductive_builder`
- Display name: Jae Bianchi
- Archetype (1-3 words): Hyperproductive
- Role (short): Extremely fast builder shipping multiple experiments per week
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$300
- Skepticism level: `low`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve only
- Data they refuse to upload: Private repos

## Behavioral Anchors
- Optimizes for time-to-first-output; will not tolerate setup friction.
- Keeps a tool only if it becomes part of a repeatable workflow.
- Bounce trigger: slow onboarding and no instant demo.

- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_hyperproductive_builder.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
