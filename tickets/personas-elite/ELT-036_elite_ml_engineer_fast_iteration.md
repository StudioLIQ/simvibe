- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_ml_engineer_fast_iteration.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_ml_engineer_fast_iteration`
- Display name: Zara Davis
- Archetype (1-3 words): Rapid ML
- Role (short): ML engineer optimizing iteration speed with strong rigor
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $50–$800
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve to pilot; team approval to scale
- Data they refuse to upload: Training data and model artifacts

## Behavioral Anchors
- Cares about eval speed, monitoring, and rollback of model changes.
- Trusts tools that integrate with existing MLOps stack.
- Red flag: vendors that cannot explain how models are validated.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/elite_ml_engineer_fast_iteration.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_ml_engineer_fast_iteration.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
