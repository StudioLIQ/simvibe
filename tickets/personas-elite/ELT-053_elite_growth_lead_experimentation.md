# ELT-053 (P1) Persona: Liam Cohen (`elite_growth_lead_experimentation`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_growth_lead_experimentation.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_growth_lead_experimentation`
- Display name: Liam Cohen
- Archetype (1-3 words): Experiment Machine
- Role (short): Growth lead running aggressive experimentation
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $200–$5000
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve to pilot; team approval to scale
- Data they refuse to upload: Ad accounts and user-level analytics

## Behavioral Anchors
- Thinks in loops: hypothesis, test, measure, iterate.
- Trusts tools with clear measurement and easy iteration.
- Red flag: claims that cannot be validated quickly.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/elite_growth_lead_experimentation.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_growth_lead_experimentation.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/elite_growth_lead_experimentation.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
