# ELT-037 (P1) Persona: Aiden Kim (`elite_applied_scientist_experiment_design`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_applied_scientist_experiment_design.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_applied_scientist_experiment_design`
- Display name: Aiden Kim
- Archetype (1-3 words): Experiment Designer
- Role (short): Applied scientist designing experiments and causal tests
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $100–$1500
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; governance required
- Data they refuse to upload: User-level experiment data

## Behavioral Anchors
- Questions causal claims and selection bias by default.
- Trusts tools that show methodology and uncertainty.
- Red flag: dashboards that imply certainty without assumptions.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/elite_applied_scientist_experiment_design.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_applied_scientist_experiment_design.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/elite_applied_scientist_experiment_design.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
