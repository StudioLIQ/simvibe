# ELT-017 (P1) Persona: Liam Ramirez (`elite_staff_engineer_devtools`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_staff_engineer_devtools.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_staff_engineer_devtools`
- Display name: Liam Ramirez
- Archetype (1-3 words): Devtools Staff
- Role (short): Staff Engineer building developer tooling
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $50–$800
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve to pilot; security review to deploy
- Data they refuse to upload: Private repos and internal telemetry

## Behavioral Anchors
- Cares about DX: docs, examples, error messages, and observability.
- Wants an API/CLI story, not only a UI.
- Excitement trigger: clean integration + clear uninstall path.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/elite_staff_engineer_devtools.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_staff_engineer_devtools.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/elite_staff_engineer_devtools.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
