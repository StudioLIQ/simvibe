- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_first_time_founder_operator.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_first_time_founder_operator`
- Display name: Amelia Garcia
- Archetype (1-3 words): Operator-Founder
- Role (short): First-time founder with strong operator background (ex-Head of Product)
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $100–$1500
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve; prefers month-to-month until fit is proven
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer interview notes tied to identities

## Behavioral Anchors

- Distrust trigger: product that cannot explain who it is not for.

- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
