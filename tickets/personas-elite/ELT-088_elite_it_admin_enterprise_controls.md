## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)

- Role (short): IT admin enforcing identity and security controls
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $200–$5000
- Skepticism level: `very_high`

- Data they refuse to upload: SSO configs, employee data, audit logs

## Behavioral Anchors
- Cares about SSO/SAML, SCIM, RBAC, audit logs, and offboarding.
- Trusts vendors with clear docs and compliance posture.
- Red flag: unclear permissions and consumer-grade security.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
