# ELT-052 (P1) Persona: Leila Stein (`elite_design_engineer_bridge`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/elite_design_engineer_bridge.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `elite_design_engineer_bridge`
- Display name: Leila Stein
- Archetype (1-3 words): Design Engineer
- Role (short): Design engineer bridging design and frontend implementation
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $50–$600
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve to pilot; team approval to standardize
- Data they refuse to upload: Private repos and proprietary components

## Behavioral Anchors
- Cares about implementability: performance, accessibility, and code quality.
- Trusts products that ship real code examples and edge-case handling.
- Red flag: pretty mockups with brittle output.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/elite_design_engineer_bridge.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/elite_design_engineer_bridge.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/elite_design_engineer_bridge.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
