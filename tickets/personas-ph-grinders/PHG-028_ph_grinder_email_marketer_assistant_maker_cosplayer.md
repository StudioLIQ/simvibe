- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/ph_grinder_email_marketer_assistant_maker_cosplayer.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `ph_grinder_email_marketer_assistant_maker_cosplayer`
- Display name: Theo Haddad
- Archetype (1-3 words): Hype Operator
- Role (short): Email marketing assistant building campaigns
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$200
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; compliance constraints apply
- Data they refuse to upload: Subscriber lists and campaign performance data

## Behavioral Anchors
- Checks Product Hunt multiple times a day (morning + lunchtime + late night) and upvotes quickly to stay visible.
- Optimizes for buzz and engagement; loves hooks, swipe files, and “growth” language.
- Comment style: "builder" energy without depth; talks about shipping and momentum, but rarely reads docs. Bounce trigger: anything that requires disciplined setup or careful thinking.

## Deliverables

- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
