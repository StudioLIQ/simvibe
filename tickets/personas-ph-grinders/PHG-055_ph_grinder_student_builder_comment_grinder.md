## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)

- Display name: Sam Nguyen
- Archetype (1-3 words): Engagement Seeker
- Role (short): Student building portfolio projects and side hustles
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$30
- Skepticism level: `low`
- Procurement reality: Personal spend only
- Data they refuse to upload: None

## Behavioral Anchors
- Checks Product Hunt multiple times a day (morning + lunchtime + late night) and upvotes quickly to stay visible.

- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
