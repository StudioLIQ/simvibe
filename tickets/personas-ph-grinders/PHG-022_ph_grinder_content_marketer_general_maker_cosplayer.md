## Seed (Must Match)

- Archetype (1-3 words): Trend Builder
- Role (short): Content marketer writing blog posts and newsletters
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$200
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve; needs brand approval for public tools
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer stories tied to identities

## Behavioral Anchors
