## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `ph_grinder_qa_manual_tester_maker_cosplayer`
- Display name: Sana Haddad
- Archetype (1-3 words): Hype Operator
- Role (short): Manual QA tester trying new tools to look productive
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$60
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; uses company stack
- Data they refuse to upload: Test accounts and internal bug database

## Behavioral Anchors
- Checks Product Hunt multiple times a day (morning + lunchtime + late night) and upvotes quickly to stay visible.
- Skims quickly and trusts whatever looks popular and easy.
