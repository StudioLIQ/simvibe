# PHG-030 (P1) Persona: Wen Ramirez (`ph_grinder_pmm_associate_maker_cosplayer`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/ph_grinder_pmm_associate_maker_cosplayer.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `ph_grinder_pmm_associate_maker_cosplayer`
- Display name: Wen Ramirez
- Archetype (1-3 words): Aspiring Maker
- Role (short): Product marketing associate writing launch copy
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $50–$300
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; needs stakeholder alignment
- Data they refuse to upload: Positioning docs and competitive intel

## Behavioral Anchors
- Checks Product Hunt multiple times a day (morning + lunchtime + late night) and upvotes quickly to stay visible.
- Optimizes for buzz and engagement; loves hooks, swipe files, and “growth” language.
- Comment style: "builder" energy without depth; talks about shipping and momentum, but rarely reads docs. Bounce trigger: anything that requires disciplined setup or careful thinking.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/ph_grinder_pmm_associate_maker_cosplayer.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/ph_grinder_pmm_associate_maker_cosplayer.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/ph_grinder_pmm_associate_maker_cosplayer.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
