# PHG-040 (P1) Persona: Hana Chen (`ph_grinder_support_rep_maker_cosplayer`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/ph_grinder_support_rep_maker_cosplayer.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `ph_grinder_support_rep_maker_cosplayer`
- Display name: Hana Chen
- Archetype (1-3 words): Aspiring Maker
- Role (short): Customer support rep handling tickets and macros
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$60
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Manager approval for any tool touching customer data
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer PII and internal tickets

## Behavioral Anchors
- Checks Product Hunt multiple times a day (morning + lunchtime + late night) and upvotes quickly to stay visible.
- Looks for macros and shortcuts; wants to look helpful fast.
- Comment style: "builder" energy without depth; talks about shipping and momentum, but rarely reads docs. Bounce trigger: anything that requires disciplined setup or careful thinking.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/ph_grinder_support_rep_maker_cosplayer.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/ph_grinder_support_rep_maker_cosplayer.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/ph_grinder_support_rep_maker_cosplayer.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
