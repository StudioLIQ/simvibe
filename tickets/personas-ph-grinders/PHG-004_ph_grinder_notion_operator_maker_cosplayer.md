# PHG-004 (P1) Persona: Daniel Patel (`ph_grinder_notion_operator_maker_cosplayer`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/ph_grinder_notion_operator_maker_cosplayer.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `ph_grinder_notion_operator_maker_cosplayer`
- Display name: Daniel Patel
- Archetype (1-3 words): Launch Addict
- Role (short): Notion-based operator selling templates and systems
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$120
- Skepticism level: `low`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve only
- Data they refuse to upload: Client docs and internal SOPs

## Behavioral Anchors
- Checks Product Hunt multiple times a day (morning + lunchtime + late night) and upvotes quickly to stay visible.
- Skims for templates, quick setup, and “does it work in 10 minutes?” more than fundamentals.
- Comment style: "builder" energy without depth; talks about shipping and momentum, but rarely reads docs. Bounce trigger: anything that requires disciplined setup or careful thinking.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/ph_grinder_notion_operator_maker_cosplayer.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/ph_grinder_notion_operator_maker_cosplayer.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/ph_grinder_notion_operator_maker_cosplayer.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
