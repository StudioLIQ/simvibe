- Output: `personas/ph_grinder_no_code_builder_comment_grinder.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `ph_grinder_no_code_builder_comment_grinder`
- Display name: Ava Alvarez
- Archetype (1-3 words): Comment Farmer
- Role (short): No-code builder shipping side projects (Bubble/Glide)
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$80
- Skepticism level: `low`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve only
- Data they refuse to upload: Client data and payment details

## Behavioral Anchors
- Checks Product Hunt multiple times a day (morning + lunchtime + late night) and upvotes quickly to stay visible.
- Skims for templates, quick setup, and “does it work in 10 minutes?” more than fundamentals.
- Comment style: confident and "supportive" but shallow; asks vague questions and repeats buzzwords. Bounce trigger: long explanations, technical nuance, or anything that feels slow.

- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
