## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `ph_grinder_content_designer_decks_maker_cosplayer`
- Display name: Mina Lee
- Archetype (1-3 words): Framework Fan

- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$120
- Skepticism level: `low`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve
- Data they refuse to upload: Internal strategy decks

## Behavioral Anchors
- Checks Product Hunt multiple times a day (morning + lunchtime + late night) and upvotes quickly to stay visible.
