- Output: `personas/ph_grinder_junior_ux_designer_comment_grinder.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `ph_grinder_junior_ux_designer_comment_grinder`
- Display name: Liam Reyes
- Archetype (1-3 words): Badge Chaser
- Role (short): Junior UX designer trying to level up fast
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$120
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve; needs manager sign-off for team tools
- Data they refuse to upload: User research recordings and internal designs

## Behavioral Anchors
- Checks Product Hunt multiple times a day (morning + lunchtime + late night) and upvotes quickly to stay visible.
- Judges by screenshots and vibe; wants quick inspiration and shareable visuals.
