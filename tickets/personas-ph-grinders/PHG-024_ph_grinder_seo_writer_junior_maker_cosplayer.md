- Output: `personas/ph_grinder_seo_writer_junior_maker_cosplayer.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `ph_grinder_seo_writer_junior_maker_cosplayer`
- Display name: Sana Ibrahim
- Archetype (1-3 words): Launch Addict
- Role (short): Junior SEO writer chasing rankings and volume
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$150
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve
- Data they refuse to upload: Client drafts and keyword strategy docs

## Behavioral Anchors
- Checks Product Hunt multiple times a day (morning + lunchtime + late night) and upvotes quickly to stay visible.
- Optimizes for buzz and engagement; loves hooks, swipe files, and “growth” language.
- Comment style: "builder" energy without depth; talks about shipping and momentum, but rarely reads docs. Bounce trigger: anything that requires disciplined setup or careful thinking.
