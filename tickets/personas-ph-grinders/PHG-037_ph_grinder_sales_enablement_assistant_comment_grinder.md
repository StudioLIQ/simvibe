- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/ph_grinder_sales_enablement_assistant_comment_grinder.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `ph_grinder_sales_enablement_assistant_comment_grinder`
- Display name: Elena Johnson
- Archetype (1-3 words): Networking Grinder
- Role (short): Sales enablement assistant updating decks and scripts
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$150
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; needs manager sign-off
- Data they refuse to upload: Internal playbooks and training docs

## Behavioral Anchors
- Checks Product Hunt multiple times a day (morning + lunchtime + late night) and upvotes quickly to stay visible.
- Wants copy/paste scripts and “objection handling”; rarely reads technical details.
- Comment style: confident and "supportive" but shallow; asks vague questions and repeats buzzwords. Bounce trigger: long explanations, technical nuance, or anything that feels slow.

## Deliverables

- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
