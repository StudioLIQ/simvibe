- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/ph_grinder_csm_associate_comment_grinder.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `ph_grinder_csm_associate_comment_grinder`
- Display name: Iris Hernandez
- Archetype (1-3 words): Comment Farmer
- Role (short): Customer success associate managing many SMB accounts
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$150
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; CRM access needed
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer contact lists and renewal notes

## Behavioral Anchors
- Checks Product Hunt multiple times a day (morning + lunchtime + late night) and upvotes quickly to stay visible.
- Wants playbooks and dashboards; prefers simple narratives over nuance.
- Comment style: confident and "supportive" but shallow; asks vague questions and repeats buzzwords. Bounce trigger: long explanations, technical nuance, or anything that feels slow.

## Deliverables

- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
