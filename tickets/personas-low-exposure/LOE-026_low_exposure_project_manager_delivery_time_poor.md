# LOE-026 (P1) Persona: Tariq Santos (`low_exposure_project_manager_delivery_time_poor`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/low_exposure_project_manager_delivery_time_poor.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `low_exposure_project_manager_delivery_time_poor`
- Display name: Tariq Santos
- Archetype (1-3 words): On-Call Brain
- Role (short): Project Manager delivering client projects
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$200
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Manager approval; procurement for new vendors
- Data they refuse to upload: Client contracts and sensitive project docs

## Behavioral Anchors
- Has 5–8 minutes max to evaluate; skims headline, screenshots, pricing, and one proof point.
- Cares about workflow fit and reporting; wants fewer meetings, not more tools.
- Will not book a call; needs a self-serve trial or a crisp demo. Bounce trigger: long onboarding or vague “AI” claims.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/low_exposure_project_manager_delivery_time_poor.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/low_exposure_project_manager_delivery_time_poor.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/low_exposure_project_manager_delivery_time_poor.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
