# Low-Exposure Persona Ticket Pack

This folder contains **100 tickets** for generating *smart but low-exposure* personas:
- They are competent and discerning
- They rarely browse launch platforms (Product Hunt, HN)
- They have very limited time/attention

Rules:
- Write the final persona doc in English using `PERSONA.md` sections 0-10 (fully filled).
- Keep it concrete: numbers, named tools, explicit constraints, and realistic behaviors.
- Persona voice block must be 2nd person and 80-160 words.

Output location:
- `personas/<persona_id>.md`

Naming:
- Persona IDs in this pack use the `low_exposure_` prefix to avoid collisions.
