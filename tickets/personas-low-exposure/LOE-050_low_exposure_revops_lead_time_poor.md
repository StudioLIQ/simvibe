- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/low_exposure_revops_lead_time_poor.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `low_exposure_revops_lead_time_poor`
- Display name: Nora Kim
- Archetype (1-3 words): Time-Starved
- Role (short): RevOps lead owning attribution and CRM hygiene
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $200–$2000
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Security review for CRM; finance approval for spend
- Data they refuse to upload: CRM data dumps and customer lists

## Behavioral Anchors
- Has 5–8 minutes max to evaluate; skims headline, screenshots, pricing, and one proof point.
- Cares about data hygiene, audit trails, and rollback; hates black boxes.
- Will not book a call; needs a self-serve trial or a crisp demo. Bounce trigger: long onboarding or vague “AI” claims.

- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
