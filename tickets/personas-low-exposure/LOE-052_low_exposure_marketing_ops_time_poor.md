- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/low_exposure_marketing_ops_time_poor.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `low_exposure_marketing_ops_time_poor`
- Display name: Priya Singh
- Archetype (1-3 words): Meeting Swamped
- Role (short): Marketing Ops manager owning tracking and tooling
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $100–$1000
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; touches tracking/CRM
- Data they refuse to upload: Tracking data, CRM fields, customer lists

## Behavioral Anchors
- Has 5–8 minutes max to evaluate; skims headline, screenshots, pricing, and one proof point.
- Cares about measurable lift and clean tracking; wants examples and quick wins.

- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
