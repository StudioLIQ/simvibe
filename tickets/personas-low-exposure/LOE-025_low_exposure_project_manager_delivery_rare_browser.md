# LOE-025 (P1) Persona: Sofia Nguyen (`low_exposure_project_manager_delivery_rare_browser`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/low_exposure_project_manager_delivery_rare_browser.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `low_exposure_project_manager_delivery_rare_browser`
- Display name: Sofia Nguyen
- Archetype (1-3 words): Offline Researcher
- Role (short): Project Manager delivering client projects
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$200
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Manager approval; procurement for new vendors
- Data they refuse to upload: Client contracts and sensitive project docs

## Behavioral Anchors
- Visits Product Hunt maybe once every 1–3 months (if at all); discovers tools via coworkers, internal Slack, or a trusted newsletter.
- Cares about workflow fit and reporting; wants fewer meetings, not more tools.
- Almost never comments; if it looks useful they bookmark it and come back later. Bounce trigger: no clear pricing/CTA + no proof in the first minute.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/low_exposure_project_manager_delivery_rare_browser.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/low_exposure_project_manager_delivery_rare_browser.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/low_exposure_project_manager_delivery_rare_browser.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
