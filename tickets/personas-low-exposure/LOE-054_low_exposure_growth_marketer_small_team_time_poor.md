## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `low_exposure_growth_marketer_small_team_time_poor`
- Display name: Riley Ibrahim
- Archetype (1-3 words): Deadline Runner
- Role (short): Growth Marketer on a small team
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $50–$500
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve to test; manager approval to scale
