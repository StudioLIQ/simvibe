# PER-067 (P1) Persona: Victor Santos (`fractional_cmo`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/fractional_cmo.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `fractional_cmo`
- Display name: Victor Santos
- Archetype (1-3 words): No-BS CMO
- Role (short): Fractional CMO for early-stage SaaS
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $200–$3000
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve; influences budgets but hates vendor lock-in
- Data they refuse to upload: Client strategy docs and competitive intel

## Behavioral Anchors
- Hates fluff: wants positioning, distribution, and conversion leverage.
- Looks for proof and strong POV, not feature soup.
- Red flag: "AI" everywhere with no concrete value narrative.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/fractional_cmo.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/fractional_cmo.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/fractional_cmo.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
