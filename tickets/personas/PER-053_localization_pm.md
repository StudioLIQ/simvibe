# PER-053 (P1) Persona: Yuki Sato (`localization_pm`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/localization_pm.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `localization_pm`
- Display name: Yuki Sato
- Archetype (1-3 words): Localization PM
- Role (short): PM for localization/internationalization at a global app
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $50–$600
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Team approval
- Data they refuse to upload: Internal strings and product roadmap

## Behavioral Anchors
- Cares about i18n workflow: translation memory, QA, context, and developer ergonomics.
- Needs integrations with existing tools and export formats.
- Red flag: treats localization as "just translate".

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/localization_pm.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/localization_pm.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/localization_pm.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
