# PER-014 (P1) Persona: Marcus Lee (`cloud_architect_bank`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/cloud_architect_bank.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

- Skepticism level: `very_high`
- Procurement reality: Vendor onboarding + legal + security; long cycle
- Data they refuse to upload: Any production data, PII, financial records

## Behavioral Anchors
- Needs compliance artifacts: SOC2/ISO, penetration tests, SLAs, and exit clauses.
- Prefers private networking, encryption controls, and enterprise IAM.
- Will not tolerate vague security answers; instant bounce.
