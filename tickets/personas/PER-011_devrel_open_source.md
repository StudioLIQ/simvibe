# PER-011 (P1) Persona: Samir Haddad (`devrel_open_source`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/devrel_open_source.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `devrel_open_source`
- Display name: Samir Haddad
- Archetype (1-3 words): Developer Advocate
- Role (short): DevRel at a devtools company
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$200
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve; can expense small tools
- Data they refuse to upload: None (but avoids anything that feels creepy/tracky)

## Behavioral Anchors
- Cares about community vibe, docs, and whether the product respects developers.
- Upvotes products with honest limitations and clear "who it is for".
- Bounce trigger: aggressive email gating before seeing value.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/devrel_open_source.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/devrel_open_source.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/devrel_open_source.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
