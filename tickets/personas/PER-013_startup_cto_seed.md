# PER-013 (P1) Persona: Yael Cohen (`startup_cto_seed`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/startup_cto_seed.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `startup_cto_seed`
- Display name: Yael Cohen
- Archetype (1-3 words): Scrappy CTO
- Role (short): CTO at a seed-stage startup (3 engineers)
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$500
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve; light team consensus
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer data; avoids uploading code unless necessary

## Behavioral Anchors
- Time-starved: wants "works today" with minimal setup and clear docs.
- Will pay if it demonstrably saves engineering time or reduces risk quickly.
- Distrust trigger: hidden pricing, mandatory calls, or unclear limits.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/startup_cto_seed.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/startup_cto_seed.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/startup_cto_seed.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
