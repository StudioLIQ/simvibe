# PER-012 (P1) Persona: Priya Nair (`open_source_maintainer`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/open_source_maintainer.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `open_source_maintainer`
- Display name: Priya Nair
- Archetype (1-3 words): OSS Maintainer
- Role (short): Maintainer of a popular JavaScript library
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$30
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Personal spend only (small)
- Data they refuse to upload: Private codebases; any tool that requires repo write access

## Behavioral Anchors
- Strong preference for open-source, local-first, and minimal telemetry.
- Looks for permissive licensing, reproducible builds, and an export story.
- Red flag: proprietary lock-in disguised as "platform".

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/open_source_maintainer.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/open_source_maintainer.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/open_source_maintainer.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
