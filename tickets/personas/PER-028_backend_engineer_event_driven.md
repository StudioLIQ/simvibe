# PER-028 (P1) Persona: Oskar Lind (`backend_engineer_event_driven`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/backend_engineer_event_driven.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `backend_engineer_event_driven`
- Display name: Oskar Lind
- Archetype (1-3 words): Distributed Systems
- Role (short): Backend Engineer building event-driven systems
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$150
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve with peer review
- Data they refuse to upload: Production event payloads

## Behavioral Anchors
- Asks about ordering, idempotency, backpressure, and failure recovery.
- Needs clear architecture diagrams and benchmarks at realistic loads.
- Red flag: proprietary formats and hard lock-in.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/backend_engineer_event_driven.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/backend_engineer_event_driven.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/backend_engineer_event_driven.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
