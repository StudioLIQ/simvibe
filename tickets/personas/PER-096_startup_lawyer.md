# PER-096 (P1) Persona: Jonah Epstein (`startup_lawyer`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/startup_lawyer.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `startup_lawyer`
- Display name: Jonah Epstein
- Archetype (1-3 words): Startup Lawyer
- Role (short): Startup attorney advising founders
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$200
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve
- Data they refuse to upload: Client contracts and sensitive communications

## Behavioral Anchors
- Zooms in on terms: privacy, liability, IP, and data processing.
- Distrust trigger: dark patterns and unclear refund policies.
- Excitement trigger: plain-language legal docs and sane defaults.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/startup_lawyer.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/startup_lawyer.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/startup_lawyer.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
