# Persona Ticket Pack

This folder contains **100 small tickets** (one per persona) so we can generate high-fidelity personas without blowing up LLM context.

Workflow:
1. Pick the next ticket in `INDEX.md`
2. Create `personas/<persona_id>.md` using `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10) **fully filled**, in English.
3. Mark the ticket file status as done and add brief completion notes.

Notes:
- Keep everything concrete (numbers, named tools, explicit constraints).
- The persona voice block must be **2nd person** and **80-160 words**.
