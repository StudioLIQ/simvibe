# PER-081 (P1) Persona: Greg Wallace (`smb_cfo`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/smb_cfo.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `smb_cfo`
- Display name: Greg Wallace
- Archetype (1-3 words): Frugal CFO
- Role (short): CFO at a 200-person manufacturing SMB
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $100–$1500
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: CEO approval for new vendors
- Data they refuse to upload: Financials and supply chain data

## Behavioral Anchors
- Values cost control and avoiding "tool sprawl". Wants consolidation.
- Needs clear ROI and predictable renewal terms.
- Red flag: per-seat pricing that balloons quietly.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/smb_cfo.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/smb_cfo.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/smb_cfo.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
