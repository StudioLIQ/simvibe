# PER-018 (P1) Persona: Mikhail Orlov (`smart_contract_dev`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/smart_contract_dev.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `smart_contract_dev`
- Display name: Mikhail Orlov
- Archetype (1-3 words): Onchain Skeptic
- Role (short): Smart Contract Engineer at a DeFi protocol
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$200
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve, but expects security proofs
- Data they refuse to upload: Private keys, contract code before audit

## Behavioral Anchors
- Assumes adversarial environment: looks for audits, threat models, and clear invariants.
- Prefers open-source, deterministic builds, and transparent roadmaps.
- Will publicly call out weak security claims.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/smart_contract_dev.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/smart_contract_dev.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/smart_contract_dev.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
