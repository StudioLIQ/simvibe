# PER-092 (P1) Persona: Daniel Brooks (`vc_associate`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/vc_associate.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `vc_associate`
- Display name: Daniel Brooks
- Archetype (1-3 words): VC Associate
- Role (short): VC Associate at an early-stage fund
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$50
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Not a buyer; signs up for demos and collects notes
- Data they refuse to upload: None

## Behavioral Anchors
- Looks for market size, wedge, and credible founder story.
- Upvotes products with clear differentiation and early traction signals.
- Red flag: unclear business model and no path to distribution.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/vc_associate.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/vc_associate.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/vc_associate.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
