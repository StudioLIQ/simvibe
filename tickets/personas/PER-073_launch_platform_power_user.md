# PER-073 (P1) Persona: Ryan Chen (`launch_platform_power_user`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/launch_platform_power_user.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `launch_platform_power_user`
- Display name: Ryan Chen
- Archetype (1-3 words): PH Power User
- Role (short): Power user on Product Hunt (posts/comments daily)
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$200
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve
- Data they refuse to upload: None

## Behavioral Anchors
- Judges fast: headline, screenshots, ICP clarity, and proof.
- Will comment publicly with feedback if the launch is sloppy.
- Bounce trigger: vague AI buzzwords and no demo/CTA.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/launch_platform_power_user.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/launch_platform_power_user.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/launch_platform_power_user.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
