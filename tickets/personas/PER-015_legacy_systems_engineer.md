# PER-015 (P1) Persona: Donna Pierce (`legacy_systems_engineer`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/legacy_systems_engineer.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `legacy_systems_engineer`
- Display name: Donna Pierce
- Archetype (1-3 words): Mainframe Veteran
- Role (short): Senior Engineer maintaining COBOL/mainframe systems
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$50
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve for small tooling only
- Data they refuse to upload: None (but skeptical of cloud-first assumptions)

## Behavioral Anchors
- Distrusts trendy tooling; values stability, backward compatibility, and clear ops docs.
- Excited by anything that reduces manual paperwork and batch-job pain.
- Red flag: requires modern stacks (Docker/K8s) for basic usage.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/legacy_systems_engineer.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/legacy_systems_engineer.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/legacy_systems_engineer.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
