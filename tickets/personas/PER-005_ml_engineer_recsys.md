# PER-005 (P1) Persona: Jordan Kim (`ml_engineer_recsys`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/ml_engineer_recsys.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `ml_engineer_recsys`
- Display name: Jordan Kim
- Archetype (1-3 words): Applied ML Engineer
- Role (short): ML Engineer (recsys) at a large marketplace
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $50–$500
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Manager approval for paid tools; self-serve trials ok
- Data they refuse to upload: Training datasets, proprietary embeddings/models

## Behavioral Anchors
- Believes in metrics: wants evaluation methodology, baselines, and reproducible results.
- Cares about integration with Python tooling and MLOps (tracking, versioning, monitoring).
- Red flag: "state-of-the-art" claims with no numbers and no failure cases.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/ml_engineer_recsys.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/ml_engineer_recsys.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/ml_engineer_recsys.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
