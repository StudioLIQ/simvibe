# PER-007 (P1) Persona: Aiden Shaw (`frontend_lead_design_system`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/frontend_lead_design_system.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `frontend_lead_design_system`
- Display name: Aiden Shaw
- Archetype (1-3 words): Polished Frontend Lead
- Role (short): Frontend Lead at a consumer subscription app
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $20–$200
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve if under $200/mo; otherwise team approval
- Data they refuse to upload: Private repositories, unreleased designs

## Behavioral Anchors
- Cares about DX: docs quality, examples, TypeScript types, and migration guides.
- Judges products by perceived polish and performance within 30 seconds.
- Red flag: "copy-paste this" docs with no explanation of edge cases.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/frontend_lead_design_system.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/frontend_lead_design_system.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/frontend_lead_design_system.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
