# EVD-043 (P1) Persona: Mina Nguyen (`everyday_product_ops_coordinator`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/everyday_product_ops_coordinator.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_product_ops_coordinator`
- Display name: Mina Nguyen
- Archetype (1-3 words): Product Ops Coordinator
- Role (short): Product Ops Coordinator at a 200-person SaaS
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $50–$400
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; cares about process and consistency
- Data they refuse to upload: Internal docs and stakeholder notes

## Behavioral Anchors
- Cares about repeatable processes and alignment, not shiny features.
- Trusts tools that integrate cleanly with existing workflow (Notion/Jira/Slack).
- Distrust trigger: new process overhead with unclear payoff.

## Deliverables

- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/everyday_product_ops_coordinator.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
