# EVD-052 (P1) Persona: Omar Nguyen (`everyday_ops_coordinator_vendor_forms`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/everyday_ops_coordinator_vendor_forms.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_ops_coordinator_vendor_forms`
- Display name: Omar Nguyen
- Archetype (1-3 words): Vendor Forms
- Role (short): Ops coordinator handling vendor intake forms
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$200
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Vendor onboarding paperwork; needs clear security answers
- Data they refuse to upload: Vendor assessments and internal approvals

## Behavioral Anchors
- Immediately looks for pricing, terms, and security posture to avoid back-and-forth.
- Distrust trigger: missing company info, unclear support, or no policy docs.
- Cares about “how do we cancel / offboard” as much as onboarding.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/everyday_ops_coordinator_vendor_forms.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/everyday_ops_coordinator_vendor_forms.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/everyday_ops_coordinator_vendor_forms.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
