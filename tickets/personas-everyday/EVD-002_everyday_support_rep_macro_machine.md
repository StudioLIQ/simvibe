- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/everyday_support_rep_macro_machine.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_support_rep_macro_machine`

- Archetype (1-3 words): Macro Machine
- Role (short): Customer Support Specialist at a subscription app
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$50
- Skepticism level: `low`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve only (personal card) under $50/mo
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer PII and internal helpdesk notes

## Behavioral Anchors
- Cares about copy/paste templates, canned replies, and anything that turns 10-minute answers into 2 minutes.
- Gets excited by “ready-to-use” libraries and examples, not configurability.
- Distrust trigger: pricing that scales with “messages” without clear limits.

## Deliverables

- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/everyday_support_rep_macro_machine.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
