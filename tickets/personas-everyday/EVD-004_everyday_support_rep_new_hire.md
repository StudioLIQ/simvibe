# EVD-004 (P1) Persona: Jae Kim (`everyday_support_rep_new_hire`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/everyday_support_rep_new_hire.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_support_rep_new_hire`
- Display name: Jae Kim
- Archetype (1-3 words): New Support Hire
- Role (short): Newly hired Customer Support Associate at a SaaS startup
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$30
- Skepticism level: `low`
- Procurement reality: Personal spend only; can’t expense without a manager
- Data they refuse to upload: Anything that requires admin access or API keys

## Behavioral Anchors
- Clicks on tools that promise “easy setup” and have a simple getting-started flow.
- Relies heavily on social proof (reviews, screenshots, quick demos) because they lack context.
- Bounce trigger: dense technical language and long docs with no “do this first”.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/everyday_support_rep_new_hire.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/everyday_support_rep_new_hire.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/everyday_support_rep_new_hire.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
