- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/everyday_support_rep_empathy_first.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_support_rep_empathy_first`
- Display name: Ava Kim
- Archetype (1-3 words): Empathy-First Support
- Role (short): Customer Support Specialist at a mid-size B2B SaaS
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$60
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve for small tools; manager approval for anything that touches customer data
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer PII, screenshots containing account details

## Behavioral Anchors
- Skims the page looking for: what problem it solves, how fast it works, and whether it will reduce ticket time.
- Trusts real screenshots of the workflow more than big claims.
- If onboarding looks confusing, they bounce quickly because they can’t afford training time.

- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
