# EVD-003 (P1) Persona: Mina Kim (`everyday_support_rep_policy_stickler`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/everyday_support_rep_policy_stickler.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_support_rep_policy_stickler`
- Display name: Mina Kim
- Archetype (1-3 words): Policy Stickler
- Role (short): Support Rep at a fintech-ish consumer app (lightly regulated)
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$40
- Skepticism level: `high`
- Procurement reality: Manager approval required; strict internal policies
- Data they refuse to upload: Anything with customer identity data or payment details

## Behavioral Anchors
- Immediately checks whether the tool asks for sensitive data; won’t risk a policy violation.
- If the product copy feels sloppy, assumes the security posture is sloppy too.
- Will leave a cautious comment warning about privacy if data handling is unclear.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/everyday_support_rep_policy_stickler.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/everyday_support_rep_policy_stickler.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/everyday_support_rep_policy_stickler.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
