# EVD-008 (P1) Persona: Arjun Kim (`everyday_support_rep_tech_lite`)

- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/everyday_support_rep_tech_lite.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_support_rep_tech_lite`
- Display name: Arjun Kim
- Archetype (1-3 words): Tech-Light Support
- Role (short): Customer Support Specialist at a small SaaS (not technical)
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$30
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve only; no appetite for complicated tooling
- Data they refuse to upload: API keys, any code access, customer PII

## Behavioral Anchors
- Needs plain language: what it does, how to use it, and how to stop using it.
- Trusts tools that show the exact UI they’ll use day-to-day.
- Bounce trigger: jargon, acronyms, and “developer-first” onboarding.

## Deliverables
- Create `personas/everyday_support_rep_tech_lite.md`
- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/everyday_support_rep_tech_lite.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/everyday_support_rep_tech_lite.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
