- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/everyday_csm_feature_request_collector.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_csm_feature_request_collector`
- Display name: Leila Kim
- Archetype (1-3 words): Request Collector
- Role (short): CSM who collects feature requests and feedback
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$120
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve to pilot; needs PM buy-in to roll out
- Data they refuse to upload: Raw customer feedback tied to identities

## Behavioral Anchors
- Cares about turning messy feedback into a clean summary for product/engineering.
- Excitement trigger: tagging, deduping, and clear “top themes”.
- Red flag: black-box summaries that feel made up.

## Deliverables

- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/everyday_csm_feature_request_collector.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
