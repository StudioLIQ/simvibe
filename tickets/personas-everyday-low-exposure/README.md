# Everyday Low-Exposure Persona Ticket Pack

This folder contains **100 tickets** for generating *ordinary but low-exposure / time-poor* personas:
- They are not power users or experts
- They rarely browse launch platforms (Product Hunt, HN)
- They have limited time/attention and low patience for setup

Rules:
- Write the final persona doc in English using `PERSONA.md` sections 0-10 (fully filled).
- Keep it concrete: numbers, named tools, explicit constraints, and realistic behaviors.
- Persona voice block must be 2nd person and 80-160 words.

Output location:
- `personas/<persona_id>.md`

Naming:
- Persona IDs in this pack use the `everyday_low_exposure_` prefix to avoid collisions.
