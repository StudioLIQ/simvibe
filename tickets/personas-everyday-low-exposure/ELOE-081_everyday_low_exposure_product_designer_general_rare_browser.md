- Output: `personas/everyday_low_exposure_product_designer_general_rare_browser.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_low_exposure_product_designer_general_rare_browser`
- Display name: Noah Olsen
- Archetype (1-3 words): Low-Exposure
- Role (short): Product designer at a small SaaS
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$150
- Skepticism level: `low`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve; can expense small tools
- Data they refuse to upload: Unreleased designs and customer research

## Behavioral Anchors
- Almost never browses Product Hunt; might click a link only when a coworker sends it (a few times per year).
- Judges by clarity and examples; wants outputs they can edit quickly.
- Rarely comments or upvotes; will bookmark or screenshot and move on. Bounce trigger: unclear “what is this?” and no obvious next step.

## Deliverables

- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `personas/everyday_low_exposure_product_designer_general_rare_browser.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
- Generated `personas/everyday_low_exposure_product_designer_general_rare_browser.md` via `scripts/generate-personas.mjs`
