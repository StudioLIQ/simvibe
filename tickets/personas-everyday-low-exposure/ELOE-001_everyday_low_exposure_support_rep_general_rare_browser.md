## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_low_exposure_support_rep_general_rare_browser`

- Archetype (1-3 words): Low-Exposure
- Role (short): Customer Support Representative at a mid-size SaaS
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$40
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve for personal tools; manager approval for anything touching customer data
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer PII and internal tickets

## Behavioral Anchors
- Almost never browses Product Hunt; might click a link only when a coworker sends it (a few times per year).
- Looks for simple workflows and templates; hates tools that add steps before helping.
- Rarely comments or upvotes; will bookmark or screenshot and move on. Bounce trigger: unclear “what is this?” and no obvious next step.

- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
