- Status: [x] Done
- Output: `personas/everyday_low_exposure_partnerships_associate_time_poor.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_low_exposure_partnerships_associate_time_poor`
- Display name: Wen Ramirez
- Archetype (1-3 words): Time-Starved
- Role (short): Partnerships associate doing intro calls and follow-ups
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$150
- Skepticism level: `low`
- Procurement reality: Self-serve to explore; approvals for contracts
- Data they refuse to upload: Partner pipeline and contract terms

## Behavioral Anchors
- Has 2–5 minutes max; skims headline, screenshots, and pricing (if visible).
- Looks for quick wins and proof they can use immediately; avoids anything that feels spammy.
- Will not book a call; needs a self-serve trial or a simple demo. Bounce trigger: long signup forms or heavy setup.

- Fill **all** sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` with concrete detail (no placeholders)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
