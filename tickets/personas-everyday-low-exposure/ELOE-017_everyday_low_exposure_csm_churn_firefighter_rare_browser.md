## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_low_exposure_csm_churn_firefighter_rare_browser`
- Display name: Noah Petrova
- Archetype (1-3 words): Quiet Browser
- Role (short): CSM in a churn-heavy phase, trying to keep customers
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $50–$250
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; needs fast wins
- Data they refuse to upload: Customer usage exports tied to identities

## Behavioral Anchors
- Almost never browses Product Hunt; might click a link only when a coworker sends it (a few times per year).
- Cares about customer outcomes and time-to-value; wants something easy to adopt and explain.
- Rarely comments or upvotes; will bookmark or screenshot and move on. Bounce trigger: unclear “what is this?” and no obvious next step.

- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
