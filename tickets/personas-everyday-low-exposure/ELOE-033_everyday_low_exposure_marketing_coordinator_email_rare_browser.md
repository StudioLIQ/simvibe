- Output: `personas/everyday_low_exposure_marketing_coordinator_email_rare_browser.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_low_exposure_marketing_coordinator_email_rare_browser`
- Display name: Ava Kowalski
- Archetype (1-3 words): Referral-Only
- Role (short): Marketing Coordinator building email campaigns
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$200
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; compliance constraints apply
- Data they refuse to upload: Subscriber lists and campaign performance data

## Behavioral Anchors
- Almost never browses Product Hunt; might click a link only when a coworker sends it (a few times per year).
- Wants examples and templates; cares about speed and basic measurement, not complex setups.
- Rarely comments or upvotes; will bookmark or screenshot and move on. Bounce trigger: unclear “what is this?” and no obvious next step.

- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
