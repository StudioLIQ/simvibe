- Output: `personas/everyday_low_exposure_cs_ops_assistant_rare_browser.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)
- Persona ID (snake_case): `everyday_low_exposure_cs_ops_assistant_rare_browser`
- Display name: Omar Davis
- Archetype (1-3 words): Not-a-Commenter
- Role (short): CS ops assistant cleaning notes and updating CRM fields
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$120
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Team approval; data hygiene matters
- Data they refuse to upload: CRM exports and customer lists

## Behavioral Anchors
- Almost never browses Product Hunt; might click a link only when a coworker sends it (a few times per year).
- Cares about customer outcomes and time-to-value; wants something easy to adopt and explain.
- Rarely comments or upvotes; will bookmark or screenshot and move on. Bounce trigger: unclear “what is this?” and no obvious next step.

- `personas/everyday_low_exposure_cs_ops_assistant_rare_browser.md` exists
- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona

## Completion Notes
