- Output: `personas/everyday_low_exposure_office_manager_rare_browser.md`

## Goal
Create a **high-fidelity** persona document based on `PERSONA.md` (sections 0-10), in English.

## Seed (Must Match)

- Role (short): Office manager at a hybrid company
- Budget range (monthly, can spend): $0–$150
- Skepticism level: `medium`
- Procurement reality: Manager approval above $100/mo
- Data they refuse to upload: Employee info and vendor contracts

## Behavioral Anchors
- Almost never browses Product Hunt; might click a link only when a coworker sends it (a few times per year).
- Wants fewer spreadsheets and fewer follow-ups; cares about reliability and permissions.
- Rarely comments or upvotes; will bookmark or screenshot and move on. Bounce trigger: unclear “what is this?” and no obvious next step.

- Includes sections 0-10 from `PERSONA.md` (fully filled)
- Voice block is 2nd person, 80-160 words
- Section 10 (Engine Mapping) is consistent with the rest of the persona
